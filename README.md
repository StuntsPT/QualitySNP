#QualitySNPng

This repository is a fork of [upstream](https://trac.nbic.nl/qualitysnp/).
It includes some changes to allow for building a static binary, which is very convinient for [4Pipe4](https://github.com/StuntsPT/4Pipe4)

##Self contained binary
You can find a mostly self contained binary under bin/QualitySNPng, which was build against Qt 4.8.6 OSE.
Due to this a GPL license was added to the repository.

Other than that, there's nothing else to sse here that you cannot find in the upstream repository.
